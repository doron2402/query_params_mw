# query_params_mw

## Why
we got had all bunch of clients send us different query params some were all lower case, all caps and etc..

## Solution
We decide to keep everything camel case

## How to use
just ` npm i --save camel-query-params`
and add this to your code:  `var camelQueryParams = require('camel-query-params');`

also you can checkout my express example


Good Luck!
